Title: Weather Forecast App

Description: This project showcases a weather forecasting application developed using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, enhanced with Bootstrap classes. When users type a city name into the search box and initiate the search, the app dynamically retrieves weather data using the WeatherAPI. It displays the current day's weather and a 5-day forecast for the specified city. The application also saves recently searched cities as clickable buttons below the search box, providing quick access to their weather information.

How to Run: Navigate to the website and enter the city name you want weather details for in the search box. The app will show the current day's forecast and a 5-day outlook, which is helpful for trip planning or staying updated on future weather conditions. After a city is searched, its name is stored as a button below the search box for easy access in the future. These city names are kept in local storage, allowing you to quickly fetch weather data with a single click. Simply click on any of the city buttons to refresh the page and display the latest weather forecast.

Hope you enjoy using the app!
